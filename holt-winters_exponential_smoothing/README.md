Visualizing Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing
==============================================
This chart shows actuals and a trend/smoothing line calculated through Holt-Winters exponential smoothing. However, this chart should work for any similar smoothing visualizations: i.e. it doesn't really care if it is Holt-Winters or another algorithm. The main thing is that it allows for visualization of two data columns as line graphs, where the 2nd column has initial and last values missing (depending on the depth of smoothing, or running averages, for instance).

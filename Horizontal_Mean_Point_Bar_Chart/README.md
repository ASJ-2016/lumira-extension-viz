The extension visualizes the value range for each group of item as the y-axis, and show the percentage more or less than themselves mean point and total average. This table shows how the brands rank based on the average of their items’ value from multiple factors. A measure of the brand’s consistency can be seen in the span of their scores, cross-referenced by how many different items they produce. The blue bars illustrate a group’s consistency by showing the value range between its top and bottom value.
